This is a website using HTML / CSS / JavaScript that processes data from an API for the University of Auckland to display data about the Computer Science department. 
The files exist with a web server that was provided to test the functionality of the site as I built it, as some of the features involve interaction with a database. Download and extract these files in the zip file if you wish to fully test the site, and not use the individual files.
