# UoACS_Website
This is a website using HTML / CSS / JavaScript that processes data from an API for the University of Auckland to display data about the Computer Science department. 
The files exist with a web server that was provided to test the functionality of the site as I built it, as some of the features involve interaction with a database. Download and extract these files in the zip file if you wish to fully test the site, and not use the individual files.

To run the service:
1) Move all files to the desktop or a file path with no spaces.
2) Update the DataRoot attriute in the web.config files of both the Open and Closed service directories to be the same as the locaion of the Data.db file
3) Open the Open Service, Closed Service, and App On Port 8189 files.
4) Site should work as submitted.
